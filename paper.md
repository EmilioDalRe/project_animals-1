# Introduction

The preponderance of animal species is the treasure we have inherited from our forefathers.
It is our responsibility, nay, our duty, to preserve this inheritance.
We are losing about 60 species a day. This may be enough to soon qualify as the sixth Mass Extinction, and is the most devastating extinction since the last Mass Extinction, 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, in which 76% of all species were lost.
